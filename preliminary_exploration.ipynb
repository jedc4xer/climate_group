    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "    We were assigned the Climate Change group. After a bit of discussion, \n",
    "    we picked 6 original questions with the expectation that we would need \n",
    "    to remove some of them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    These are the questions that we picked:\n",
    "        1. How much does forest area impact C02 emissions?\n",
    "        2. How does population growth align with C02 emissions?\n",
    "        3. Does C02 emissons impact mortality rate?\n",
    "        4. Does renewable energy use impact freshwater withdrawals?\n",
    "        5. Does population density or growth impact freshwater withdrawals?\n",
    "        6. Is there a negative correlation between C02 emissions and renewable energy use.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    These are the datasets: \n",
